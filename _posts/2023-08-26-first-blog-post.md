## Some thoughts about Data Science  

### When we say "Data Science", what do we mean? What is Data Science About?
Put simply, Data Science is about making sense of our world through the data that surrounds us. 
Data Scientists collect, manage, explore/analyze, visualize and communicate, and sometimes build predictive or exploratory models using statistical methods or machine learning techniques. As described by Khandelwal in an Indeed article, *Data Scientist vs. Statistician: What’s the Difference* (Khandelwal 2023),  Data Scientists engage with many kinds of data – quantitative data, text, images.  They are employed to solve real world problems, often in business, government and increasingly nonprofit organizations. 

***To me, Data Scientists shape the way we frame and solve problems.***

### Major Duties and Knowledge Areas: 
Data Scientists tackle a variety of tasks and, as described by Sasikumar (Sasikumur 2023), have a variety of skills including "hacking skills, knowledge of math and statistics, and subject matter expertise". A data science team may be formed by an organization to capture all the knowledge and skill needed to make use of data effectively and efficiently. As described in these readings, the Data Science team will collect or engineer storage and access to data. Next, they will “clean” and organize raw data so it can then be used to describe a phenomenon. They may draw inferences, model and predict future outcomes based on the data collected. 

A central goal  of the team is to have a quality process that is reproducable and valid process and to communicate with decision makers to answer questions or make recommendations.  A good summary of the roles and the knowledge areas needed within a Data Science team can be found in *A Practitioners Guide to Data Science, 1.2 Data Science Roles* (Lin & Li, 2023).

***I believe a major role of the data science team is find ways to turn data into impact. Data Scientists that can collaborate to 1) define what questions to ask, 2) identify what data and tools are needed for analysis and 3)communicate results,  become the lifeblood of a data driven organization.***

### What is the Difference between Data Scientists and Statisticians?
A broad discussion of the differences between Data Scientists and Statisticians is found in Khandelwal's web article (Khandelwal 2023).  As he points out, there is an overlap of skills in these roles: both professionals need to be able to effectively access data, use mathematical tools to explore, analyze and produce models to support decision making, and have some level of subject matter experience.  Statisticians however have a greater depth of knowledge in the field of math and statistics and may work more frequently with sample data to produce inferences about a population, using the scientific method rooted in hypothesis testing to build a theory.  Data Scientist, in contrast, may "wrangle” more unstructured data and may be more concerned with using techniques to discover unforseen or unexpatterns within empirical data.

### Where do I fit in?
I have 20+ years working in a variety of organizations: large consumer goods and services companies, small consulting firms, start-ups and nonprofits.  While the focus of my career has largely been in marketing analytics and marketing system development, there have been many twists and turns along the way. Over the last 5 years, I have become more engaged in research to support my work.  

Currently, I lean more towards the statistician side of the Data Science team, and as a result, I am working to extend my knowledge of statistical methods. Over the years, I have wrangled a lot of data, completed a lot of exploratory analyses, and built dashboards and marketing systems to make data driven decisions. I have a life long love of math and a deep curiosity about statistical methods. I am looking forward to refreshing my hacking skills as I enter this GitHub world!
